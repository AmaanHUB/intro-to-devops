# Introduction To DevOps

## History of Development, Operations, And Infrastructure

* Software Development:
	* 1990s:
		* Waterfall model most likely
	* 2000s:
		* Agile practices start (see Interview-Prep repository for more details)
	* 2010-Present:

* Automation!
* **Four Pillars Of DevOps:**
	* Flexibility
	* Robustness
	* Cost
	* Ease Of Use

* **DevOps Lifecycle:**
	* Build
	* Code
	* Plan
	* Monitor
	* Operate
	* Deploy
	* Release
	* Test

* **Overall stages:**
	* Continuous Integration
	* Continuous Delivery
	* Continuous Deployment


# Environments

* TL;DR: Where code runs
* Virtual Environments (.e.g. venv or env for Python):
	* Increases Robustness

* 3 Main Environments:
	* Dev
		* Should mirror the testing and production environments
	* Testing
	* Deployment/Live

## Virtual Machines (VM) and Vagrant
